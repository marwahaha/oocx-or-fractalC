an object of type surf3d contains three points or objects of type p3d.
that is, we can consider a surf3d type as multiple inheritance of three
p3d object type branches. because of multiple, we have first select one, 
but then we can talk to a surf3d object type as as we talk to a p3d one,
that is, a surf3d it is also a p3d type. that's inheritance, in that case,
multiple, without having to reprogram interface in each object innherited.
