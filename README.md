oocx-or-fractalC
================
C as C++, but C (multiple inheritance, none inheritance at all, implicit polymorphism...)
-unique interface: say(nameObj, "message"), which in turn returns also a message.
-a set of global extern functions to manage messages.
-it is fractal because objects with multiple inheritance are fractals (not in a preciss mathematical term) and because everything is an object, including a program.
